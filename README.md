# IntelSGX_NeuralNetwork
This is the implementation of Neural Network on Intel SGX, with an evaluation on MNIST. (Note: the final version will be given in one month.) This program is one of my intern projects during HKUST Cybersecurity Laboratory 2021 summer intern.

2021/9/28: The main realization of Intel SGX is given. The code is still under revision and will be modified for better readability. And execution instruction and evaluation report will be given later.
